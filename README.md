Overview



This case study details an OSINT investigation into a recruitment firm suspected of engaging in fraudulent job postings, résumé harvesting, and financial deception. The investigation was conducted using publicly available information, leveraging techniques such as WHOIS lookups, business registration searches, LinkedIn analysis, and PPP loan records.



The findings suggest that the entity in question may have misrepresented its operations, obtained financial benefits under false pretenses, and engaged in deceptive hiring practices.



Objective



The goal of this investigation was to:

1. Verify the legitimacy of a recruitment firm advertising job openings.

2. Determine whether the business was active and legally registered.

3. Identify any patterns of suspicious behavior, such as loan fraud or résumé harvesting.



Methodology



1. Business Registration Search

• Conducted a state business registry search to confirm the company’s legal status.

• Found that the business was listed as inactive/withdrawn, meaning it was no longer legally operating.

• Cross-checked another company linked to the same individuals, which had no official business registration.



2. WHOIS & Domain Analysis

• Performed a WHOIS lookup on the company’s website.

• Owner details were redacted, which is sometimes normal but raised concerns given other suspicious findings.



3. PPP Loan Database Search

• Queried public PPP loan records to check for federal loans received by the company.

• Discovered two forgiven PPP loans despite no evidence of payroll, employees at the time of the loans, or business activity.

• Compared the loan timeline to the business registration status, finding potential discrepancies.



4. LinkedIn & Social Media Investigation

• Examined LinkedIn company profiles and employee listings.

• Noted duplicate profiles for the same person, one linked to the dissolved company that is still operating and another to a newly created business.

• Identified inconsistent job postings, including a non-existent role at a casino that was later replaced with a different, lower-paying role.



5. Job Posting Analysis

• Investigated job postings listed on the company’s website.

• Found no detailed descriptions, only city/state locations, and a direct email submission button—a known red flag for résumé harvesting.

• Identified inconsistencies in job postings across platforms, with some listings missing on legitimate hiring sites.



Findings

1. The recruitment firm was no longer legally registered but continued posting jobs and interacting with applicants.

2. The company’s website was inactive, yet job listings were still being updated.

3. The business received PPP loans despite no visible employees or legitimate business activity at the time.

4. Key individuals rebranded under a new business name, possibly repeating the same suspicious activities.

5. A LinkedIn recruiter offered a fake job, then failed to follow up, later shifting to a different role with a significantly lower salary.

6. Job postings lacked details, suggesting résumé harvesting or data collection.



Conclusion



This investigation strongly suggests fraudulent activity, including:

• Fake job postings to collect résumés.

• Potential misuse of government loans.

• A pattern of dissolving and rebranding businesses.



The findings were reported to relevant authorities, including federal agencies, for further review.



Lessons Learned & OSINT Takeaways



This case highlights key red flags in business fraud investigations:

✔ Check business registration databases—inactive or non-existent businesses are a major warning sign.

✔ Analyze domain activity.

✔ Verify job legitimacy—fake job postings often lack detail, use vague descriptions, and request direct résumé submissions.

✔ Look for patterns in LinkedIn activity—duplicate profiles and sudden rebrands can indicate deception.

✔ Cross-check financial records—PPP loans or other funding tied to inactive businesses can indicate fraud.
